- [X] Revert CarController, but add * Time.fixeddeltatime to allow prefab to work
- [X] Revert CarVision
- [ ] Checkout and manual merge NeuralCarInputSource and NeuralNetworkTrainer
- [ ] More checkpoints as input
- [ ] Normal distribution option for mutation shit
- [ ] Make it so you can reload with smaller populations; Make return type short instead of ushort to display a warning here
- [ ] Normalize the network and look up what that does
- [X] Application targetFramerate anschauen in trainer
- [X] Car vision needs reset method and needs to be called on car reset
- [ ] Redo memory neurons as feedback neuros and make them configurable
- [ ] Implement actual memory neurons
- [X] Adaptive time using manual physics stepping and timers... oh boy; Only give choice between adaptive and real-time (maybe?)
- [X] Update leniency manually in trainer, call just returns stored field
- [X] See that no fixedupdate survives
- [ ] Settings for squaring fitness after each track & round
